     * @brief One schedulable unit producing an int result, owned by a Scheduler.
     * @detail A Job runs `task` until it returns > 0 (complete), returns 0 to
     * repeat on the next execute(), or returns < 0 to cancel. `exit` runs
     * exactly once, when the job completes, cancels, or is destroyed.
     * `dependencies` gate execution: the job only runs once every listed JobID
     * has completed.
     * @note Ownership: Owned by the owning Scheduler (std::vector<Job>).
     * `task`/`exit` may capture what the job needs, but captured references
     * must live at least until the job is destroyed. The Scheduler is drained
     * before containers/modules are destroyed, so jobs must not capture
     * Container/Module/Resource that could die earlier.
     * @example
     * @code
     * JobID id = scheduler.createJob([&] { doWork(); return 1; });
     * scheduler.dependsOn(id, otherJob);

    /**
     * @brief Owns and advances a set of Jobs with dependency ordering.
     * @detail Execution contract:
     * - Single-threaded: jobs run serially, in creation order, never
     *   concurrently, on the thread that calls execute(). The Scheduler is not
     *   thread-safe and must be driven from one thread at a time.
     * - execute() runs every ready, incomplete job once per call. A job whose
     *   dependencies are not all completed is skipped until a later pass.
     * - A task returning > 0 completes the job, < 0 cancels it; both run exit()
     *   and count as finished for run()/jobCount(). Returning 0 keeps the job
     *   scheduled for the next pass (a repeating/frame job).
     * - Mutations from inside a task or exit callback (createJob,
     *   destroyJob, exitAll, dependsOn) are deferred until the pass finishes,
     *   so re-entrant use does not invalidate iterators or references.
     *   execute() itself is not re-entrant and throws if called within a pass.
     * - Exceptions thrown by a task propagate out of execute(); the job is not
     *   marked finished and runs again on a later pass. Deferred mutations are
     *   still flushed so the scheduler stays consistent.
     * - exitAll()/clear() run exit() once per live job and drain the scheduler.
     * - Job ordering is deterministic: within a pass, ready jobs run in the
     *   order they were created.
     * @note Ownership: Owned by `Application` (m_scheduler, by value). It
     * uniquely owns every Job. Application::unloadGame() drains it (exitAll)
     * before destroying frameworks/containers, so jobs never outlive the
     * objects they capture.
     * @example
     * @code
     * Scheduler scheduler;
     * JobID init = scheduler.createJob([] { return 1; });
     * JobID loop = scheduler.createJob([&] { return game.mainloop(); });
     * scheduler.dependsOn(loop, init);
     * while (!scheduler.done()) scheduler.execute();
